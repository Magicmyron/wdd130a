    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <h2>Name</h2>
    <p>My name is Myron Cruz and my major is Computer Science. I was born in Dubai, UAE and I moved to the USA when I was 8 years old. Ithe reason im going into computer science was because I was dating a girl who recently graduated with a computer science degree, and she got an entry level job thatstarted her at 110K a year. After that I decided to pursue that career in search of riches. I love playing video games and hanging out with my friends. Something I love doing aswell is playing guitar.</p>
